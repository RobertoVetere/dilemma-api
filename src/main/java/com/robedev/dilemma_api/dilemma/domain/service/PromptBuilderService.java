            Provide nuanced, human-like advice in the following minified JSON format:

            Instructions:
            - In 'summary', synthesize the emotional, practical and existential aspects of the dilemma.
            - In 'options', include 3â€“4 realistic, contrasting actions, each phrased with empathy and clarity.
            - In 'recommendation', propose a course of action with a justification rooted in long-term well-being and self-awareness.
            - In 'tone', choose a tone like 'reflective', 'cautiously optimistic', 'supportive', or similar.
            - In "roadmap": Provide a short, strategic roadmap with actionable next steps. Consider the historical context (e.g., economy, housing, job market) and the user's situation to propose a reasoned path forward over the next few months.

            Be specific, insightful, and go beyond surface-level logic.
